# RecipeME
## Description
This app allows users to post recipes online for anyone to view and use. Users can create an account and log in to be able to post recipes and save their favorite recipes from other users of the site.

## Technologies Used
This project features a Nextjs frontend and a Django backend with Postgres for the database. Django-rest-framework is used to handle APIs and token-based user authentication.

- As a user I would like to be able to protect my submissions through a log-in system.
- As a user I would like to be able to keep a list of my favorite users and their recipes.
As a user I would like to be able to easily navigate the site.

## Unsolved problems/hurdlles
I had many issues with deployment to heroku, which worked initially but broke somewhere along the way. Authentication presented major hurdles as I tried to implement it while learning django-rest-framework at the same time.
