## Unsolved problems/hurdlles
I had many issues with deployment to heroku, which worked initially but broke somewhere along the way. I had github issues when I created a react app in folder where my nextjs app was. Things got weird and I had to create a new repo. Authentication presented major hurdles as I tried to implement it while learning django-rest-framework at the same time. Sudden storms and power outages.
